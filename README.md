# cpp-calendar
The development of calendars has always been a fascinating aspect of human history, serving as essential tools for organizing and tracking time. In this project, we delve into the analysis of calendars spanning multiple years, with the goal of uncovering recurring patterns that can be manipulated to create our own custom calendar.

By closely examining the behavior of the first day of each month over time, we discovered a consistent trend that allowed us to predict its movement. Additionally, we encountered the unique challenges presented by leap years, which required special consideration due to the introduction of an extra day.

Through careful analysis and problem-solving, we tackled these issues and gained valuable insights for our calendar implementation project.
